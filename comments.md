# Comments

## Definition

A comment is a note or annotation in the source code that is intended for human readers and is ignored by the computer when the code is executed.

## Purpose

Comments are used to explain what the code does, why certain decisions were made, or to provide any other information that might help someone understand the code better.

## Types

### Single-line comments

These are brief comments that occupy a single line.

### Multi-line comments

These can span multiple lines and are used for more detailed explanations.

## Usage

### Documentation

Comments can describe the purpose of the code, how it works, and any important details.

### Clarification

They can clarify complex or non-obvious parts of the code.

### TODOs

Comments can be used to mark areas of the code that need further work or future improvements.

### Debugging

Temporarily disable parts of the code without deleting them.

Think of comments as notes you leave for yourself or others to make the code easier to understand and maintain. They are crucial for collaboration and long-term maintenance of software projects.
